Description: With the advance in high-throughput technology for molecular
    assays, multi-omics datasets have become increasingly available. In this
    workshop, we will demonstrate using the pathwayPCA package to perform
    integrative pathway-based analyses of multi-omics datasets. In particular,
    we will demonstrate through three case studies the capabilities of
    pathwayPCA to 1) perform pathway analysis with gene selection, 2) integrate
    multi-omics datasets to identify driver genes, 3) estimate and visualize
    sample-specific pathway activities in ovarian cancer, and 4) identify
    pathways with sex-specific effects in kidney cancer.
