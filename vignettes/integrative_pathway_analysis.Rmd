# Workshop Description

With the advance in high-throughput technology for molecular assays, multi-omics datasets have become increasingly available. In this workshop, we will demonstrate using the pathwayPCA package to perform integrative pathway-based analyses of multi-omics datasets. In particular, we will demonstrate through three case studies the capabilities of pathwayPCA to

- perform pathway analysis with gene selection,
- integrate multi-omics datasets to identify driver genes,
- estimate and visualize sample-specific pathway activities in ovarian cancer, and
- identify pathways with sex-specific effects in kidney cancer.

# Introduction

`pathwayPCA` is an integrative analysis tool that implements the principal component analysis (PCA) based pathway analysis approaches.^[ [Chen et al. (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btn458) ] ^[ [Chen et al. (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1002/gepi.20532) ] ^[ [Chen (2011)](https://doi.org/10.2202/1544-6115.1697) ] `pathwayPCA` allows users to:



1. Test pathway association with binary, continuous, or survival phenotypes.
2. Extract relevant genes in the pathways using the SuperPCA and AESPCA approaches.
3. Compute *principal components* (PCs) based on the selected genes. These estimated latent variables represent pathway activities for individual subjects, which can then be used to perform integrative pathway analysis, such as multi-omics analysis.
4. Extract relevant genes that drive pathway significance as well as data corresponding to these relevant genes for additional in-depth analysis.
5. Perform analyses with enhanced computational efficiency with parallel computing and enhanced data safety with S4-class data objects.
6. Analyze studies with complex experimental designs, with multiple covariates, and with interaction effects, e.g., testing whether pathway association with clinical phenotype is different between male and female subjects.

## Pathway-based PCA

### Pathways and Pathway Data

- Let $\textbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}_{n \times p}$ be the observed single-omics data (gene expression, protein expression, copy-number variation, etc.).
- We follow Tidy Data design^[ [Wickham, 2014](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10) ] and record subjects in the rows and -ome features in the columns.
- Based on expert knowledge of the problem at hand, curate a set of biological pathways $1, \ldots, K$, where pathway $k$ contains $p_k$ -ome measurements.


### Differences in Approach

<font color="#005030">**JAMES EDIT HERE**</font>

- Many tools, including <font color="#005030">**tool1**</font>^[ CITE1 ] and <font color="#005030">**tool2**</font>^[ CITE2 ], ignore expert-based biological information contained in biological pathways.
- Other tools, such as <font color="#005030">**tool3**</font>^[ CITE3 ] and <font color="#005030">**tool4**</font>^[ CITE4 ], incorporate biological pathways *after* PCs are extracted from the entire data set. This is figuratively like putting a holiday feast into a blender and trying to taste the individual dishes: the PCs will extract global -omic signals while drowning out the effects of individual biological pathways.
- Because biological pathways should--in theory--only have one source of defined variability, we extract a single PC from the pathway-specific data subsets


## AESPCA
Adaptive, Elastic-net, Sparse PCA (AESPCA) combines into a single objective function the following methods:

- <font color="#005030">**Elastic-Net**</font>^[ [Zou and Hastie, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x) ]
- <font color="#005030">**Adaptive Lasso**</font>^[ [Zou, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1198/016214506000000735) ]
- <font color="#005030">**Sparse PCA**</font>^[ [Zou, Hastie, and Tibshirani, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1198/106186006X113430) ]

AESPCA extracts principal components from pathway $k$ which minimize this composite objective function


## Supervised PCA

Supervised PCA (SuperPCA):

- ranks each feature in pathway $k$ by its univariate relationship with the outcome of interest (survival time, tumor size, cancer subtype, etc.), then
- extracts principal components from the <font color="#005030">**most relevant features**</font>

# Case study 1: identifying significant pathways in protein expressions associated with survival outcome in ovarian cancer data

## Ovarian cancer dataset 
For this example, we will use the mass spectrometry based global proteomics data for ovarian cancer recently generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC).^[<https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac>] The gene-level, log-ratio normalized protein abundance expression dataset for tumor samples can be obtained from the LinkedOmics database.^[<http://linkedomics.org/data_download/TCGA-OV/>] We used the dataset “Proteome (PNNL, Gene level)” which was generated by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).^[<https://www.pnnl.gov/>] One subject was removed due to missing survival outcome. Missing values in proteins expression data were imputed using the Bioconductor package `impute` under default settings. The final dataset consisted of 5162 protein expression values for 83 samples.

## Creating an `Omics` data object for pathway analysis
First, we need to create an `Omics`-class data object that stores

(1) the expression dataset 
(2) phenotype information for the samples
(3) a collection of pathways 

### Expression and Phenotype Data
We can obtain protein expression and phenotype datasets for the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset by downloading the raw files from the LinkedOmics website. However, for ease and to save time, we include cleaned and imputed versions of these datasets within this package (for the cleaning process, please see the `clean_multi_omics.R` file in `inst/scripts`).
```{r loadAssay}
data("ovPheno_df")
data("ovProteome_df")
```

The `ovProteome_df` dataset is a data frame with protein expression levels and TCGA sample IDs. The variables (columns) include expression data for 4763 proteins for each of the 83 samples.
```{r printProtAssay}
head(ovProteome_df[, 1:5])
```

The `ovPheno_df` data frame contains TCGA sample IDs and survival outcome: overall survival time and censoring status.
```{r printPhenoAssay}
ovPheno_df
```


### Pathway Collections
For the collection of pathways in (3), we need to specify a `.gmt` file, a text file with each row corresponding to one pathway. Each row contains an ID (column `TERMS`), an optional description (column `description`), and the genes in the pathway (all subsequent columns). Pathway collections in `.gmt` form can be downloaded from the MSigDB database.^[<http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp>]

For WikiPathways,^[<https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways>] one can download monthly data releases in `.gmt` format using the `dowloadPathwayArchive()` function in the `rWikiPathways` package from Bioconductor. For example, the following commands^[<https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/rWikiPathways/inst/doc/Overview.html#4_give_me_more>] downloads the latest release of the human pathways from WikiPathways to your current directory (we do not evaluate this code):
```{r rWikiPathways, eval=FALSE}
# DONT RUN
library(rWikiPathways)
# library(XML) # necessary if you encounter an error with readHTMLTable
downloadPathwayArchive(
  organism = "Homo sapiens", format = "gmt"
) 
```
```
trying URL 'http://data.wikipathways.org/current/gmt/wikipathways-20190110-gmt-Homo_sapiens.gmt'
Content type '' length 174868 bytes (170 KB)
downloaded 170 KB
```
```{r printWPgmtpath, echo=FALSE}
print("wikipathways-20190110-gmt-Homo_sapiens.gmt")
```

`pathwayPCA` includes the June 2018 Wikipathways collection for *homo sapiens*, which can be loaded using the `read_gmt` function:  
```{r ourWikiPWC}
dataDir_path <- system.file(
  "extdata", package = "pathwayPCA", mustWork = TRUE
)
wikipathways_PC <- read_gmt(
  paste0(dataDir_path, "/wikipathways_human_symbol.gmt"),
  description = TRUE
)
```

This pathway collection contains:

1. `pathways`: a list of character vectors with the names of the -omes recorded in the assay
2. `TERMS`: a character vector of the names of the pathways
3. `description`: (OPTIONAL) descriptions or URLs of the pathways

```{r inspectOutWikiPWC}
wikipathways_PC
```

### Create an `OmicsSurv` Data Container
Now that we have these three data components, we create an `OmicsSurv` data container. Note that when `assayData_df` and `response` are supplied from two different files, the user must match and merge these data sets by sample IDs. The assay and response must have matching row names, otherwise the function will error
```{r createOmics, comment=""}
ov_OmicsSurv <- CreateOmics(
  # protein expression data
  assayData_df = ovProteome_df, 
  # pathway collection
  pathwayCollection_ls = wikipathways_PC,
  # survival phenotypes
  response = ovPheno_df,
  # phenotype is survival data
  respType = "survival",
  # retain pathways with > 5 proteins
  minPathSize = 5  
)
```

To see a summary  of the `Omics` data object we just created, simply type the name of the object:
```{r inspectOmicsObj}
ov_OmicsSurv
```

## Testing pathway association with phenotypes
### Method Description
Once we have a valid `Omics` object, we can perform pathway analysis using the AESPCA or SuperPCA methodology as described above.

Briefly, in the AESPCA method, we first extract PCs representing activities within each pathway using a dimension reduction approach based on adaptive, elastic-net, sparse principal component analysis. The estimated latent variables are then tested against phenotypes using either a parametric or permutation test (permuting the sample responses). Note that the AESPCA approach does not use the response information to estimate pathway PCs, so it is an unsupervised approach.

This is in contrast to the SuperPCA approach, where a selected subset of genes most associated with disease outcome are used to estimate the latent variable for a pathway. Because of this gene selection step, the test statistics from the SuperPCA model can no longer be approximated well using the Student's $t$-distribution. To account for the gene selection step, `pathwayPCA` estimates $p$-values from a two-component mixture of Gumbel extreme value distributions instead.

### Implementation 
Because the syntax for performing SuperPCA is nearly identical to the AESPCA syntax, we will illustrate only the AESPCA workflow below. 

We estimate pathway significance via the following model: `phenotype ~ intercept + PC1`. Pathway $p$-values are estimated based on a likelihood ratio test that compares this model to a null model (with intercept only). Note that when the value supplied to the `numReps` argument is greater than 0, the `AESPCA_pvals()` function employs a non-parametric test of to assign the statistical significance of this model.
```{r aespcaCall, comment=""}
ovarian_aespcOut <- AESPCA_pVals(
  # The Omics data container
  object = ov_OmicsSurv,
  # One principal component per pathway
  numPCs = 1,
  # Use parallel computing with 2 cores
  parallel = TRUE,
  numCores = 2,
  # # Use serial computing
  # parallel = FALSE,
  # Estimate the p-values parametrically
  numReps = 0,
  # Control FDR via Benjamini-Hochberg
  adjustment = "BH"
)
```

This `ovarian_aespcOut` object contains 3 components: a table of pathway $p$-values, AESPCA-estimated PCs of each sample from each pathway, and the loadings of each protein onto the AESPCs.
```{r inspectAESPCAout}
names(ovarian_aespcOut)
```

### The pathway analysis results
For this ovarian cancer dataset, the top 5 most significant pathways identified by AESPCA are:
```{r headPVals, results='asis'}
kable(
  getPathpVals(ovarian_aespcOut, numPaths = 10)
)
```

Before constructing a graph of the $p$-values, we extract the top 20 pathways (the default value for `numPaths` is 20): 
```{r subset_top_genes}
ovOutGather_df <- getPathpVals(ovarian_aespcOut, score = TRUE)
```

Now we plot the pathway significance level for the top 20 pathways. In this figure, `score` indicates the negative natural logarithm of the unadjusted $p$-values for each pathway.
```{r pathway_bar_plots, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(ovOutGather_df) +
  # set overall appearance of the plot
  theme_bw() +
  # Define the dependent and independent variables
  aes(x = reorder(terms, score), y = score) +
  # From the defined variables, create a vertical bar chart
  geom_col(position = "dodge", fill = "#005030", width = 0.7) +
  # Add a line showing the alpha = 0.0001 level
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.0001), size = 1, color = "#f47321") +
  # Add pathway labels
  geom_text(
    aes(x = reorder(terms, score), label = reorder(description, score), y = 0.1),
    color = "white",
    size = 2, 
    hjust = 0
  ) +
  # Set main and axis titles
  ggtitle("AESPCA Significant Pathways: Ovarian Cancer") +
  xlab("Pathways") +
  ylab("Negative Log10 (p-Value)") +
  # Flip the x and y axes
  coord_flip()
```

### Extract relevant genes from significant pathways 
Because pathways are defined *a priori*, typically only a subset of genes within each pathway are relevant to the phenotype and contribute to pathway significance. In AESPCA, these relevant genes are the genes with nonzero loadings in the first PC of AESPCs.

For example, for the "IL-1 signaling pathway" (Wikipathways WP195^[<https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP195>]), we can extract the **PC**s and their protein **L**oadings using the `getPathPCLs()` function:
```{r getWP195pcl}
wp195PCLs_ls <- getPathPCLs(ovarian_aespcOut, "WP195")
wp195PCLs_ls
```

The proteins with non-zero loadings can be extracted using the following lines: 
```{r WP195loads}
wp195Loadings_df <- 
  wp195PCLs_ls$Loadings %>% 
  filter(PC1 != 0)
wp195Loadings_df
```

We can also prepare these loadings for graphics: 
```{r loadDirections}
wp195Loadings_df <- 
  wp195Loadings_df %>% 
  # Sort Loading from Strongest to Weakest
  arrange(desc(abs(PC1))) %>% 
  # Order the Genes by Loading Strength
  mutate(featureID = factor(featureID, levels = featureID)) %>% 
  # Add Directional Indicator (for Colour)
  mutate(Direction = factor(ifelse(PC1 > 0, "Up", "Down"))) 
```

Now we will construct a **col**umn chart with `ggplot2`'s `geom_col()` function.
```{r graphLoads, fig.height = 3.6, fig.width = 6.5}
ggplot(data = wp195Loadings_df) +
  # Set overall appearance
  theme_bw() +
  # Define the dependent and independent variables
  aes(x = featureID, y = PC1, fill = Direction) +
  # From the defined variables, create a vertical bar chart
  geom_col(width = 0.5, fill = "#005030", color = "#f47321") +
  # Set main and axis titles
  labs(
    title = "Gene Loadings on IL-1 Signaling Pathway",
    x = "Protein",
    y = "Loadings of PC1"
  ) +
  # Remove the legend
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

Alternatively, we can also plot the correlation of each gene with first PC for each gene. These correlations can be computed by using the `TidyCorrelation()` function in `pathwayPCA`'s vignette “Chapter 5 - Visualizing the Results”, Section 3.3.^[<https://gabrielodom.github.io/pathwayPCA/articles/Supplement5-Analyse_Results.html#gene-correlations-with-pcs>]

### Subject-specific PCA estimates   
In the study of complex diseases, there is often considerable heterogeneity among different subjects with regard to underlying causes of disease and benefit of particular treatment. Therefore, in addition to identifying disease-relevant pathways for the entire patient group, successful (personalized) treatment regimens will also depend upon knowing if a particular pathway is dysregulated for an individual patient.

To this end, we can also assess subject-specific pathway activity. As we saw earlier, the `getPathPCLs()` function also returns subject-specific estimates for the individual pathway PCs.
```{r wp195PCs, fig.height = 3.6, fig.width = 6.5}
ggplot(data = wp195PCLs_ls$PCs) +
  # Set overall appearance
  theme_classic() + 
  # Define the independent variable
  aes(x = V1) +
  # Add the histogram layer
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, color = "#005030", fill = "#f47321") +
  # Set main and axis titles
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Sample-specific Estimate of Pathway Activities",
    subtitle = paste0(wp195PCLs_ls$pathway, ": ", wp195PCLs_ls$description),
    x = "PC1 Value for Each Sample",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

This graph shows there can be considerable heterogeneity in pathway activities between the patients. 

### Extract analysis dataset for significant pathways   
Users are often also interested in examining the actual data used for analysis of the top pathways, especially for the relevant genes with the pathway. To extract this dataset, we can use the `SubsetPathwayData()` function. These commands extract data for the most significant pathway (IL-1 signaling):
```{r subsetWP195data}
wp195Data_df <- SubsetPathwayData(ov_OmicsSurv, "WP195")
wp195Data_df
```

We can also perform analysis for individual genes belonging to the pathway: 
```{r dataSubsetMod}
library(survival)
NFKB1_df <- 
  wp195Data_df %>% 
  select(EventTime, EventObs, NFKB1)

wp195_mod <- coxph(
  Surv(EventTime, EventObs) ~ NFKB1,
  data = NFKB1_df
)
```

Now we inspect the wrangled output from the Cox PH model:
```{r dataSubsetSummary, results='asis', message=FALSE}
wp195pretty_mod <- prettify(
  summary(wp195_mod)
)

kable(wp195pretty_mod)
```

Additionally, we can estimate Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients with high or low expression values for individual genes: 
```{r NFKB1Surv}
# Add the direction
NFKB1_df <- 
  NFKB1_df %>% 
  mutate(NFKB1_Expr = ifelse(NFKB1 > median(NFKB1), "High", "Low"))

# Fit the survival model
NFKB1_fit <- survfit(
  Surv(EventTime, EventObs) ~ NFKB1_Expr,
  data = NFKB1_df
)
```

Finally, we can plot these K-M curves over NFKB1 protein expression.
```{r NFKB1SurvPlot, message=FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}
ggsurvplot(
  NFKB1_fit,
  conf.int = FALSE, pval = TRUE,
  xlab = "Time in Days",
  palette = c("#f47321", "#005030")
)
```

# Case study 2: an integrative multi-omics pathway analysis of ovarian cancer data
While copy number alterations are common genomic aberrations in ovarian carcer, recent studies have shown these changes do not necessarily lead to concordant changes in protein expression. In Section 2.3 above, we illustrated testing pathway activities in protein expression against survival outcome. In this section, we will additionally test pathway activities in copy number against survival outcome. Moreover, we will perform integrative analysis to identify those survival -associated protein pathways, genes, and samples driven by copy number alterations.

## Creating copy number `Omics` data object for pathway analysis
We can identify copy number (CNV) pathways significantly associated with survival in the same way as we did for protein expressions. This gene-level CNV data was downloaded from the same LinkedOmics database.

```{r CNVsetup}
data("ovCNV_df")
```

And now we create an `Omics` data container.
```{r CNVomics, eval=FALSE}
ovCNV_Surv <- CreateOmics(
  assayData_df = ovCNV_df,
  pathwayCollection_ls = wikipathways_PC,
  response = ovPheno_df,
  respType = "survival",
  minPathSize = 5
)
```
```
1230 gene name(s) are invalid. Invalid name(s) are: ...

There are 549 samples shared by the assay and phenotype data.

  ======  Creating object of class OmicsSurv  =======
The input pathway database included 5831 unique features.
The input assay dataset included 24776 features.
Only pathways with at least 5 or more features included in the assay dataset are
  tested (specified by minPathSize parameter). There are 424 pathways which meet
  this criterion.
Because pathwayPCA is a self-contained test (PMID: 17303618), only features in
  both assay data and pathway database are considered for analysis. There are 5637
  such features shared by the input assay and pathway database.
```

Finally, we can apply the AESPCA method to this copy-number data container. Due to the large sample size, this will take a few moments.
```{r CNV_aespca, eval=FALSE}
ovCNV_aespcOut <- AESPCA_pVals(
  object = ovCNV_Surv,
  numPCs = 1,
  parallel = TRUE,
  numCores = 20,
  numReps = 0,
  adjustment = "BH"
)
```
```

Part 2: Calculate Pathway p-Values

```

Rather than execute this code yourself, we have included the output object with this package:
```{r CNV_aespca_read}
data(ovCNV_aespcOut)
```

## Identifying significant pathways and relevant genes in both CNV and protein level
Next, we identify the intersection of significant pathways based on both CNV and protein data. First, we will create a data frame of the pathway $p$-values from both CNV and proteomics.
```{r multiOmicsPvals}
# Copy Number
CNVpvals_df <- 
  getPathpVals(ovCNV_aespcOut, alpha = 0.05) %>% 
  mutate(rawp_CNV = rawp) %>% 
  select(description, rawp_CNV)

# Proteomics
PROTpvals_df <- 
  getPathpVals(ovarian_aespcOut, alpha = 0.05) %>% 
  mutate(rawp_PROT = rawp) %>% 
  select(description, rawp_PROT)


# Intersection
SigBoth_df <- inner_join(PROTpvals_df, CNVpvals_df, by = "description")
# WnT Signaling Pathway is listed as WP363 and WP428
```


The results showed there are 32 pathways significantly associated with survival in both CNV and protein data. Here are the top-10 most significant pathways (sorted by protein data significance): 
```{r intersectPaths}
SigBoth_df
```

Similar to the protein pathway analysis shown in Section 2.3.4, we can also identify relevant genes with nonzero loadings that drives pathway significance in CNV. The "IL-1 signaling pathway" (WP195) is significant in both CNV and protein data.
```{r wp195}
# Copy Number Loadings
CNVwp195_ls <- getPathPCLs(ovCNV_aespcOut, "WP195")
CNV195load_df <- 
  CNVwp195_ls$Loadings %>% 
  filter(abs(PC1) > 0) %>% 
  rename(PC1_CNV = PC1)

# Protein Loadings
PROTwp195_ls <- getPathPCLs(ovarian_aespcOut, "WP195")
PROT195load_df <- 
  PROTwp195_ls$Loadings %>% 
  filter(abs(PC1) > 0) %>% 
  rename(PC1_PROT = PC1)

# Intersection
inner_join(CNV195load_df, PROT195load_df)
```

The result showed that NFKB1 is one of the genes selected by AESPCA when testing IL-1 signaling pathway (WP195) against survival outcome in both CNV and protein pathway analysis.

Because the proteomics data were recorded on a subset of the subjects shown in the copy number data, we can further examine the relationship between CNV and protein expressions for this gene.
```{r mergeGene}
NFKB1data_df <- inner_join(
  ovCNV_df %>% 
    select(Sample, NFKB1) %>% 
    rename(CNV_NFKB1 = NFKB1),
  ovProteome_df %>% 
    select(Sample, NFKB1) %>% 
    rename(PROT_NFKB1 = NFKB1)
)
```

This Pearson test shows that the correlation between CNV and protein expression is highly significant for this gene.
```{r NFKB1cor, comment=""}
NFKB1_cor <- cor.test(NFKB1data_df$CNV_NFKB1, NFKB1data_df$PROT_NFKB1)
NFKB1_cor
```

We can then visualize the multi-omics relationship for the NFKB1 gene using a scatterplot.
```{r NFKB1plot, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4}
ggplot(data = NFKB1data_df) +
  # Set overall appearance
  theme_bw() +
  # Define the dependent and independent variables
  aes(x = CNV_NFKB1, y = PROT_NFKB1) +
  # Add the scatterplot
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  # Add a trendline
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, size = 1) +
  # Set main and axis titles
  labs(
    title = "NFKB1 Expressions in Multi-Omics Data",
    x = "Copy Number Variation",
    y = "Protein Expression"
  ) +
  # Include the correlation on the graph
  annotate(
    geom = "text", x = 0.5, y = -0.6,
    label = paste("rho = ", round(NFKB1_cor$estimate, 3))
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "text", x = 0.5, y = -0.7,
    label = "p-val < 10^-5"
  )
```

## An integrative view on patient-specific pathway activities 

In Section 2.3.5, we have seen that there can be considerable heterogeneity in pathway activities between the patients. One possible reason could be that copy number changes might not result in changes in protein expression for some of the patients. `pathwayPCA` can be used to estimate pathway activities for each patient, both for protein expressions and copy number expressions separately. These estimates can then be viewed jointly using a Circos plot.

![](circosPlot.PNG){width=100%}

The accompanying Circos plot shown normalized copy number (inner circle) and protein expression (outer circle) pathway activities for the IL-1 signaling pathway in the ovarian cancer dataset samples. Each bar corresponds to a patient sample. Red bars indicate lower expression values and negative pathway activity for the sample, while blue color bars indicate higher expression values and stronger pathway activity for the sample. Note that only some patients have concordant changes in copy number and protein expression. The code to make this plot is included in `inst/scripts/circle_plot.R`.

# Case study 3: analysis of studies with complex designs
`pathwayPCA` is capable of analyzing studies with multiple experimental factors. In this section, we illustrate using `pathwayPCA` to test differential association of pathway expression with survival outcome in male and female subjects.

## Data setup and AESPCA analysis
For this example, we used IlluminaHiSeq gene expression RNAseq data from the TCGA KIRP cohort, which we downloaded from the Xena browser datahub.^[<https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/>] (This process is described in `inst/scripts/explore_KIRP.R`.) First, we load the KIRP data, create an `Omics` data container, and extract first AESPC from each pathway. 
```{r kidneyData}
data("kirpPheno_df")
data("kirpRNAseq_df")
```

```{r kidneyOmics, eval=FALSE}
# Create Omics Container
kidney_Omics <- CreateOmics(
  assayData_df = kirpRNAseq_df,
  pathwayCollection_ls = wikipathways_PC,
  # Exclude the gender indicator for now
  response = kirpPheno_df[, 1:3],
  respType = "surv",
  minPathSize = 5
)
```
```
317 genes have variance < epsilon and will be removed. These gene(s) are: ...

30 gene name(s) are invalid. Invalid name(s) are: ...

There are 320 samples shared by the assay and phenotype data.

  ======  Creating object of class OmicsSurv  =======
The input pathway database included 5831 unique features.
The input assay dataset included 20213 features.
Only pathways with at least 5 or more features included in the assay dataset are
  tested (specified by minPathSize parameter). There are 423 pathways which meet
  this criterion.
Because pathwayPCA is a self-contained test (PMID: 17303618), only features in
  both assay data and pathway database are considered for analysis. There are 5566
  such features shared by the input assay and pathway database.
```
```{r kidneyAESPCA, eval=FALSE}
# AESPCA
kirpRNAseq_aespcOut <- AESPCA_pVals(
  object = kidney_Omics,
  numPCs = 1,
  parallel = TRUE,
  numCores = 2,
  numReps = 0,
  adjustment = "BH"
)
```
```

Extracting Pathway PCs in Parallel: DONE

Part 2: Calculate Pathway p-Values
Initializing Computing Cluster: DONE
Extracting Pathway p-Values in Parallel: DONE

Part 3: Adjusting p-Values and Sorting Pathway p-Value Data Frame

```

Once again, this will take a few moments (on my machine, this takes 1.9 minutes over 20 cores). Rather than execute this code yourself, we have included the output object with this package:
```{r kidneyAESPCAload}
data("kirpRNAseq_aespcOut")
```


## Test for sex interaction with first PC
Next we can test whether there is differential pathway association with survival outcome for males and females by the following model,
\[
h(t) = h_0(t) \exp\left[ \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{PC}_1 + \beta_2\text{male} + \beta_3(\text{PC}_1 \times \text{male}) \right].
\]

In this model, $h(t)$ is expected hazard at time $t$, $h_0 (t)$ is baseline hazard when all predictors are zero, variable $male$ is an indicator variable for male samples, and $PC_1$ is a pathway’s estimated first principal component based on AESPCA. 

In order to test the sex interaction effect for all pathways, we will write a function which tests the interaction effect for one pathway.
```{r sexInteractFun}
TestIntxn <- function(pathway, pcaOut, resp_df){
  
  # For the given pathway, extract the PCs and loadings from the pcaOut list
  PCL_ls <- getPathPCLs(pcaOut, pathway)
  # Select and rename the PC
  PC_df <- PCL_ls$PCs %>% rename(PC1 = V1)
  # Join the phenotype data to this PC
  data_df <- inner_join(resp_df, PC_df, by = c("Sample" = "sampleID"))
  
  # Construct a survival model with sex interaction
  sex_mod <- coxph(
    Surv(time, status) ~ PC1 + male + PC1 * male, data = data_df
  )
  # Extract the model fit statistics for the interaction
  modStats_mat <- t(
    coef(summary(sex_mod))["PC1:maleTRUE", ]
  )
  colnames(modStats_mat) <- c("coef", "exp_coef", "se_coef", "z", "pVal")
 
  # Return a data frame of the pathway and model statistics
  list(
    statistics = data.frame(
      terms = pathway,
      description = PCL_ls$description,
      modStats_mat,
      stringsAsFactors = FALSE
    ),
    model = sex_mod
  )

}
```

As an example, we can test it on pathway WP195, 
```{r testNewFun}
TestIntxn("WP195", kirpRNAseq_aespcOut, kirpPheno_df)$model
```

We can also apply this function to a list of pathways and select the significant pathways:  
```{r applyTestSexFun}
paths_char <- kirpRNAseq_aespcOut$pVals_df$terms
interactions_ls <- lapply(
    paths_char,
    FUN = TestIntxn,
    pcaOut = kirpRNAseq_aespcOut,
    resp_df = kirpPheno_df
)
names(interactions_ls) <- paths_char

interactions2_df <- 
  # Take list of interactions
  interactions_ls %>% 
  # select the first element (the data frame of model stats)
  lapply(`[[`, 1) %>% 
  # stack these data frames
  bind_rows() %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  # sort the rows by significance
  arrange(pVal)

kable(
  interactions_df %>% 
    filter(pVal < 0.05)
)
```

The results showed the most significant pathway is [WP1559](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP1559) (“TFs Regulate miRNAs related to cardiac hypertrophy”). We can inspect the model results for this pathway directly.
```{r modelRes}
summary(interactions_ls[["WP1559"]]$model)
```

The results showed that although sex is not significantly associated with survival outcome, the association of pathway gene expression (PC1) with survival is highly dependent on sex of the samples.

## Survival curves by sex interaction
For visualization, we can divide subjects according to sex and high or low PC-expression, and add a group indicator for the four groups.
```{r kidneySurvPlotData}
# Bind the Pheno Data to WP1559's First PC
kidneyWP1559_df <- inner_join(
  kirpPheno_df,
  getPathPCLs(kirpRNAseq_aespcOut, "WP1559")$PCs,
  by = c("Sample" = "sampleID")
)

# Add Grouping Feature
kidneySurvWP1559grouped_df <- 
  kidneyWP1559_df %>% 
  rename(PC1 = V1) %>% 
  # add strength indicator
  mutate(direction = ifelse(PC1 > median(PC1), "High", "Low")) %>% 
  # group by interaction of sex and strength on PC
  mutate(group = paste0(direction, ifelse(male, "_Male", "_Female"))) %>% 
  # remove summarized columns
  select(-male, -PC1, -direction)
```

Now we can plot survival curves for the four groups.
```{r plotKidneyGroupedSurv, message=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
# Fit the survival model
fit <- survfit(
  Surv(time, status) ~ group,
  data = kidneySurvWP1559grouped_df
)

ggsurvplot(
  fit, conf.int = FALSE, 
  xlab = "Time in Days",
  ylim = c(0.4, 1)
)
```

These Kaplan-Meier curves showed that while high or low pathway activities were not significantly associated with survival in male subjects (green and purple curves, respectively), female subjects with high pathway activities (red) had significantly worse survival outcomes than those with low pathway activities (blue).
